# Welcome

Build. Ship. Scale. Repeat.

Merchandice is the home for practical SaaS tools, experiments, and products designed to save time, reduce friction, and quietly do their job—so you can focus on yours.

## What Is Merchandice?

Merchandice is not a single product.  
It’s a **product studio**—run lean, built fast, and optimized for usefulness.

Each product here solves a specific problem:

- No bloated features  
- No fake “AI magic”  
- No meetings about meetings  

Just tools that work.

## Who It’s For

Merchandice is built for people who value:

- Speed over ceremony  
- Simplicity over complexity  
- Ownership over vendor lock-in  

If you are:

- A founder  
- A solo builder  
- A small team  
- Or someone tired of duct-taping tools together  

You’re in the right place.

## Why Merchandice Exists

Most software today is:

- Over-engineered  
- Over-marketed  
- Under-delivering  

Merchandice exists to do the opposite.

I build small, focused products with:

- Clear purpose  
- Honest limitations  
- Sustainable pricing  

No hype. No dark patterns. No “coming soon” for three years.

## Built by a Duopreneur

Merchandice is built and run by a duopreneur—meaning:

- Decisions are fast  
- Feedback loops are short  
- Support talks to the person who built the product  

If something breaks, it gets fixed.  
If something’s confusing, it gets simplified.
